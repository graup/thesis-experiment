    <p><strong>Please take the following short personality test consisting of 12 items.</strong></p>
    <p>These items refer to a series of hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario describes an incident and lists three ways of responding to it. Please read each scenario, imagine yourself in that situation, and then consider each of the possible responses. Think of each response option in terms of how likely it is that you would respond that way. We all respond in a variety of ways to situations, and probably most or all responses are at least slightly likely for you. If it is very unlikely that you would respond the way described in a given response, you should circle answer 1 or 2. If it is moderately likely, you would select a number in the mid range, and if it is very likely that you would respond as described, you would circle answer 6 or 7.</p>
    <p>Please be honest and remember that there is no "correct" or "desirable" answer.</p>
    <p>Your results will be saved anonymously (but if you want, you can tell me your email address at the end and I will send you your results).</p>
